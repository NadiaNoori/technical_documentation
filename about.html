    <h1>What is Html?</h1>
    <pre>   Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
   It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets
   and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</pre><br>

     <h2>HTML Basics</h2>
     <pre>
   Headings and paragraphs are some common HTML elements that we see on all websites. In HTML, h1 to h6 tags represent 
   headings and are used to describe the contents below them. The paragraph or the p tag in HTML helps users define a paragraph.
   The most important elements in web design are good navigation, concise and effective pages, working links, and, most importantly, 
   good grammar and spelling. Keep these things in mind as you add color and graphics and your website will be off to a great start.

     <h2>What is main HTML structure?</h2>
<pre>   The main HTML element represents the dominant content of the body of a document. 
   The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or
   expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.</pre><br>

   <h2>HTML Inline</h2>
   <pre>   Inline elements display in a line. They do not force the text after them to a new line. An anchor 
   (or link) is an example of an inline element. You can put several links in a row, and they will display in a line.</pre>
